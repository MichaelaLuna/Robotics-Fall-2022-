/* This program is used to create a Light Chaser in RGB LED using the Arduino UNO Board. 
Connecting the RGB LED to pin 12,11,10 and 9 to control it.
Using the command digitalWrite to write a HIGH or LOW value to the digital pins, to open or close the RGB LED.
Using the command delay to have a time delay during the blinking of RGB LED which creates the Light Chaser effect on it.
The main theme is digitalWrite.
