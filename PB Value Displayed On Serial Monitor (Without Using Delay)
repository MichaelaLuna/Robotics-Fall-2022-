/* The goal of this program is to turn on and off a 
   light emitting diode (LED)connected to a digital pin
   from the Arduino UNO, without using the delay() function 
   which means that other code can run at the same time 
   without being interrupted by the LED code and to also 
   show the value of a pushbutton wether it is on 1(ON) or
   0(OFF). The theme of this program is about the using of
   const int, unsigned long, const long and the if else().
