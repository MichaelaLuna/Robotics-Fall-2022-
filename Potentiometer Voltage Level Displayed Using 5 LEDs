/* The goal of this program to control five LEDs with the help of a 
 * potentiometer. A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with 
 * a wiper that acts as an adjustable voltage divider. Using the Arduino
 * UNO board and the pin A0 from it, we would be able to control which
 * light we want to turn on with these five LEDs; either turning them
 * all at the same time or if we want the inverse of it. The theme of this
 * is learning how to use the analogRead(), how to convert the bit value to
 * a voltage value and how to use the conditional statement if else().
