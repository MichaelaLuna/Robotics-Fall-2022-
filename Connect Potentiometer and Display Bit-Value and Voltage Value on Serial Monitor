/* This program is used to explore the use and capabilities of a potentiometer.
 * A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a wiper that acts as an
 * adjustable voltage divider. With the help of the Arduino UNO board and the 
 * IDE of it, we would be able to know the bit value and even the voltage value
 * that our potentiometer produces as we rotates it. As the wiper of the 
 * potentiometer goes to the left side or zero, the voltage goes up and the inverse
 * for the other way. The goal of this program is to learn how to use analogRead() 
 * which will allow us to read a bit value and learn how to convert it to a voltage value.
