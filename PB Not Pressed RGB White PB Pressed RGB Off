/* This program is used to control an RGB led. A RGB led is a combination of three 
 * LEDs in just one package: red, green and blue. This led can be controlled in
 * various ways, for example, controlling it with a push button and producing
 * various colors with playing with the mix of HIGH and LOW. The goal of this
 * program is to learn how to control an RGB and to use the condition statement
 * if else ().
