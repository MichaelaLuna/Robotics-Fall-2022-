/* This program is used to read the value of a Push Button using the Serial Monitor in Arduino UNO.
   The value of the Push Button when there is no resistance is unstable and it will give either 0 when
   it is not receiving any voltage or 1 if it is receiving the 5V from the Arduino UNO board. That is 
   the reason why we need to put a resistor either by pullup or pulldown; to have a specific and fixed
   value. In the Arduino UNO, there are already built-in resistors that can be activated by using the 
   command INPUT_PULLUP which is the main theme of this program as well.
 */

int Push_Button = 8; //indicate that pin 8 is connected to the pushbutton

void setup(){ //run the code once
  
  pinMode(Push_Button,INPUT_PULLUP); //activates the INPUT_PULLUP in the arduino board
                                     //INPUT_PULLUP is the pullup resistor built inside
                                     
  Serial.begin(9600); //open the serial port at 9600 bps
  
}

int PbState = digitalRead(8); //read value of the pushbutton

void loop(){ //run the code on loop
  
  Serial.println(PbState); //prints the read value of the pushbutton
