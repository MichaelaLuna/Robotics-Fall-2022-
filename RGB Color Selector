/* This program is used to create a Color Selector in RGB LED using the Arduino UNO Board. 
   Connecting the RGB LED to pin 12,11 and 10 to control it. An RGB led is a combination of 
   three LEDs in just one package: red, green and blue but that does not limit RGBs attributes.
   This electronic component has various ways to produce various amount of colors although it
   only has three main colors. This three main colors' values can be range to 0-255 and that 
   range can be mix and that can produce almost every type of color. The goal of this program
   is to learn how to create our own function & learn how to call it when we need it and also 
   to learn when to use the analogWrite, like in this situation, where the brightness can be 
   controlled only by an analog sigal for this means range.
